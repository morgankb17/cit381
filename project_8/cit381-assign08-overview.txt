My database consist of different grocery items in a supermarket and the different properties they have. 
For example, a banana would have a product type 'fruit' while also having a product number, a price number,
who it's supplied from, and the amount currently stocked. The database also keeps track of purchases and 
who they are purchased by. This database could be used to keep track of inventory for a specific supermarket
as well as keep track of products' suppliers and how to contact them when a product is ready to be restocked.
