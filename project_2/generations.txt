Assign the person who has the highest hierarchy in the family that is invited to the wedding number zero (0). 
(ex. granpda would have generation 0). Then whoever has the family type mother, father, uncle, or aunt would 
get generation number 2. The next line, son, daughter, brother, sister, or cousin, would get generation number 2.

In the person table, a new column should be added named "generationID," which list which generation a person is.
There should be script within the person table that auto-updates the generationID table with the correct number
depending on who has the highest hierarchy/generation "0." It would then auto-fill rows with "1" for those who are
offspring to that person/generation 0, and continue with the same logic for however long the family tree goes.
